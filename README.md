# Derme - Cosmetic Wellness Platform

**Course:** Software Engineering Project - Fall 2025
**Group:** Super Cool Guys (Group 8)

## 1.0 Project Overview

Derme is a mobile application designed to help users with sensitive skin and allergies analyze ingredients in cosmetic products. By scanning products, users can identify potential allergens, track skin reactions, and make safer choices for their personal care routines.

## 2.0 Problem Statement

Many individuals with sensitive skin and cosmetic allergies struggle to identify safe products. Reading ingredient labels can be time-consuming and difficult, especially when ingredients have multiple names. Derme solves this problem by providing an easy-to-use web application that:

- Scans ingredient labels using OCR technology
- Identifies potential allergens based on user profiles
- Cross-references ingredients against known allergen databases
- Handles ingredient synonyms and alternative names
- Tracks safe products for future reference

## 2.1 Implementation

This repository contains a fully functional Flask web application that implements the core features of Derme. The application includes:

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system
- **Allergen Management**: Users can add, track, and remove their personal allergens
- **OCR Scanning**: Upload images of ingredient labels for automatic text extraction
- **Ingredient Analysis**: Intelligent analysis that identifies allergens and cross-references with databases
- **Synonym Database**: Handles multiple names for the same ingredients
- **Product Tracking**: Save and view safe products

For deployment instructions, see [README_DEPLOYMENT.md](README_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## 3.0 Core System Goals

Our goal is to build a system that can:
* **Scan Products:** Allow users to scan product barcodes or upload images of ingredient labels.
* **Analyze Ingredients:** Cross-reference ingredients against a known allergen database and a user's personal allergy list.
* **Track Symptoms:** Provide a journal for users to log skin reactions and connect them to specific products.
* **Provide Alerts:** Notify users about potential flare-ups based on environmental data (pollen, air quality).
* **Offer Emergency Support:** Integrate features to contact emergency services and share allergy information.
