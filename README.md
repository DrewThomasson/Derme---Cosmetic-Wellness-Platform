## Project Overview

Derme is a mobile application designed to help users with sensitive skin and allergies analyze ingredients in cosmetic products. By scanning products, users can identify potential allergens, track skin reactions, and receive personalized recommendations.

## Core System Goals

Our goal is to build a system that can:
* **Scan Products:** Allow users to scan product barcodes or upload images of ingredient labels.
* **Analyze Ingredients:** Cross-reference ingredients against a known allergen database and a user's personal allergy list.
* **Track Symptoms:** Provide a journal for users to log skin reactions and connect them to specific products.
* **Provide Alerts:** Notify users about potential flare-ups based on environmental data (pollen, air quality).
* **Offer Emergency Support:** Integrate features to contact emergency services and share allergy information.
