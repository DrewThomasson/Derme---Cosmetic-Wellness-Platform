Our goal is to build a system that can:
* **Scan Products:** Allow users to scan product barcodes or upload images of ingredient labels.
* **Analyze Ingredients:** Cross-reference ingredients against a known allergen database and a user's personal allergy list.
* **Track Symptoms:** Provide a journal for users to log skin reactions and connect them to specific products.
* **Provide Alerts:** Notify users about potential flare-ups based on environmental data (pollen, air quality).
* **Offer Emergency Support:** Integrate features to contact emergency services and share allergy information.
